### Adaman (designed by P.D. Magnus):
- Deck selection (base, extended and others)
- Optional setting to filter out unsolvable games (this will also filter out some solvable games which the simple AI are not smart enough to solve in five tries, and may make the overall difficulty slightly easier).
- An unofficial variant to reduce the chance of unavaildable losing: stop replenishing resources if there are 5 personalities in palace.

## How to play

### Defend and Capture
- Select one single (not multiple) card in hand and select a card/slot in defence/side area, then click the 'Play' button to play the card in hand to the slot.
- Select a card in defence/side area, do NOT select any card in hand, then click the 'Counterattack' button to launch a counterattack from the selected card.
- Select one single (not multiple) card in hand and select a card in captured area, then click the 'Interchange' button to interchange them.
- Select one single (not multiple) card in hand and select a card in damaged area, then click the 'Sacrifice' button to sacrifice.
- Select a card in defence/side area, do NOT select any card in hand, then click the 'Withdraw' button to withdraw the selected card back to hand.
- Select any number of cards in hand and click the 'Discard Cards Finish Turn' button to discard the selected cards in hand and finish the turn. 

If you are not seeing a button for your desired action, you are not making a correct selection.

### Adaman (designed by P.D. Magnus):
- Select cards in Resource you want to spend and select one card in Palace/Capital you want to control. Click the 'Confirm' button.
