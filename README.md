# Features:

- Close at any time and then resume the game when you launch it again (for most games).

# Game specific features:
## Defend and Capture
- 

## Myrmex (designed by Greg James):
- Customizable number of columns, number of rows at startup, and card rank range. This provides easier variants than the official base game.
- All cards face-up variant.

## Adaman (designed by P.D. Magnus):
- Deck selection (base, extended and others)
- Optional setting to filter out unsolvable games (this will also filter out some solvable games which the simple AI are not smart enough to solve in five tries, and may make the overall difficulty slightly easier).
- An unofficial variant to reduce the chance of unavaildable losing: stop replenishing resources if there are 5 personalities in palace.
